I'm still thinking about this feature, thea idea is to be able to make a request to API endpoint add_sources with another parameter of type boolean which would read file line by line and add sources into database

Code would look something like this:
----------------------------------------------------------------
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("proxys.db", check_same_thread=False)
cursor = conn.cursor()

sql = "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO sources(source) VALUES(?)"

with open("sources.txt", "r") as sources:
    for source in sources.readlines():
        cursor.execute(sql, [source.replace("\n", "")])
        conn.commit()
----------------------------------------------------------------
